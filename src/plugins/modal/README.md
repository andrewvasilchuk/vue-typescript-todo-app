As stated in the description of the test task: "Верстка должна быть выполнена без использования UI библиотек (например Vuetify)".
So... I have to create a plugin for modal windows by my own.
I have already done the similar task, which have resulted in a dedicated package creation.
You can find it here https://github.com/andrewvasilchuk/vue-accessible-modal
But if the usage of UI libs is restricted, so be it. Let's reimplement it.
